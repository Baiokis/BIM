With compatibility for mobile devices, AR and VR, you can easily bring dimensioning to any environment. The plugin supports dynamic transforms, meaning changes to your objects in real-time will be accurately reflected in the dimensions. A variety of units including custom units, and full control over materials, color, and text parameters, make it easy to customize the appearance of your dimensions. Our selection system and highlight feature, along with trigger events for hover and selection, makes it easy to interact with your dimensions.
